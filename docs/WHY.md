# Why

^ [Back to home](../README.md)


There seemed to be a lack of decent frameworks that dealt with
the challenges of micro-service applications. Things like low-
latency inter-service calls, vertical and horizontal scaling 
solutions as well as modern client communication protocols that are not 
limited to web. 

Kalm aims at being the reference in terms of micro-service framework and 
modern back-end technology for apps and games.

Right now, Kalm is a pet project that grew from 2 guys being 
frustrated at the currently offered back-end stacks. There is no plan
for wither of uss to work on this full time. Hence pet-project.

Merge requests are more than welcommed. We will try to keep the
contributors circle small, but make sure that every requests gets
addressed as soon as possible.
